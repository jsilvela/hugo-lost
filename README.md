# Hugo Lost

Hugo Lost is a departure from [Hugo Zen](https://github.com/rakuishi/hugo-zen), adding a few bits I needed for my sites
(Lost Among Notes and Lost Among Europeans), and simplifying
the CSS.

## Installation & Usage

Best used as a submodule in your hugo project.

``` sh
git submodule add {this repo} themes/lost

```

## Configuration

In this theme you can add variables to your site config file. The following is the example config:

``` toml
[params]
  copyright = "Name of copyright holder"
  twitter   = "twitter handle"
  email     = "owner email"
  goatcounter = "goatcounter url"
```
